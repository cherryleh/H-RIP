# Running locally:
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist
http://localhost:80

Had to edit 'sudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf' to point to /Users/jgeis/Work/H-RIP
I've since put it back to the original and added a link to the one in my work directory.

### Install and start apache
``` 
sudo apt install apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

### Install PHP
#### Windows:
```
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php
sudo systemctl restart apache2.service  
```
#### Mac/Linux
```
sudo apt install php
sudo apachectl restart
```

### Download the H-RIP code
```
cd /var/www/html
sudo git clone https://github.com/cherryleh/H-RIP.git
```

#### View the site via the internal remote web browser (the one in the web desktop):
To get internal IPs
```
hostname -I   
```
The command gave a list of IPs, one of which was 172.17.0.1.  

Bring up 172.17.0.1/H-RIP on the browser in the web desktop.

#### To view on your local machine via localhost port forwarding: 

- Get your local machine's IP address.  
- Run the following command on your local machine with the bracketed parts filled in:
```
ssh -v -L 3000:<your local machine's IP adress>:3000 exouser@<remote machine's IP address>
```
Example: 

~~ssh -v -L 3000:192.168.1.13:3000 exouser@149.165.159.19~~  
```
ssh -v -L 3000:192.168.1.66:3000 exouser@149.165.159.160  
```
- Then go to http://<remote-machine's IP address>/H-RIP/ in your local browser.

Example:  
~~http://149.165.159.19/H-RIP/~~  
http://149.165.159.160/H-RIP/

~~### mesonet example~~  
~~#ssh -L 3000:192.168.1.13:3000 exouser@149.165.152.187~~  
~~#http://149.165.152.187:8080/~~  
~~#Then go to http://localhost:3000/tapis-ui in local browser.~~  



### Install php:

To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
```
sudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

    LoadModule php_module /usr/local/opt/php/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>
```
Finally, check DirectoryIndex includes index.php:
```
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
```

The php.ini and php-fpm.ini file can be found by:
```
    whereis php
```
For the setup we have:  
~~/usr/local/etc/php/8.3/~~
```
less /etc/php/8.3/cli/php.ini
less /etc/php/8.3/apache2/php.ini
```

To start php now and restart at login:
```
  brew services start php
```
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
```
  /usr/local/opt/php/sbin/php-fpm --nodaemonize
```


```
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
```

TODO: set up a certificate for php:  https://www.simplified.guide/macos/apache-php-homebrew-codesign


TODO:
- look at rainfall.py line 38, "dir_path = '../RID'"  That doesn't look right.
- Need to get rid of header menus "Select Ranch, About, Links, Contact" or make them work.
- Need to get rid of the "Learn More" button in the header or make it actually go somewhere.
- Fix the absolute urls in the header and on index.html (http://149.165.159.19/H-RIP/)
